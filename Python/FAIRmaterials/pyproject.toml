description = """
Translates several CSV files with ontological terms and corresponding
data into RDF triples. These RDF triples are stored in OWL and JSON-LD files,
facilitating data accessibility, interoperability, and knowledge unification.
The triples are also visualized in a graph saved as an SVG. The input CSVs
must be formatted with a template from a public Google Sheet; see README or
vignette for more information. This is a tool is used by the SDLE Research
Center at Case Western Reserve University to create and visualize material
science ontologies, and it includes example ontologies to demonstrate its
capabilities. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s
